Creating an "Automata Simulator" in Java is a complex and extensive project.
To give you a head start, I'll provide a simplified outline and some code snippets to help you get started. You can expand upon this foundation as you develop your project.

### Project Outline

1. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing or JavaFX to allow users to interact with your automata simulator.
   - Create a canvas or drawing area where users can design automata by adding states and transitions.

2. **Automata Types**:
   - Implement support for Finite Automata (FA), Pushdown Automata (PDA), and Turing Machines (TM).
   - Allow users to choose the type of automaton they want to work with.

3. **State and Transition Representation**:
   - Define data structures to represent states and transitions for each type of automaton.
   - Implement functionalities to add, edit, and delete states and transitions.

4. **Simulation**:
   - Develop algorithms to simulate automata based on user-defined inputs.
   - Provide feedback to users on whether the input is accepted or rejected by the automaton.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Create a visual representation of automata with states and transitions.
   - Highlight the current state during simulation.
   - Allow users to label transitions.

6. **File I/O**:
   - Implement file import/export functionality so users can save and load automata configurations.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle invalid automaton configurations gracefully and provide informative error messages.

8. **Documentation**:
   - Include comprehensive documentation within the application and possibly external documentation files to guide users.

### Java Code Snippets

Here are some simplified code snippets to illustrate how you can start building parts of your Automata Simulator in Java:

1. **Creating a Simple Swing GUI**:

```java
import javax.swing.*;

public class AutomataSimulator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {
            JFrame frame = new JFrame("Automata Simulator");
            frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
            frame.setSize(800, 600);

            // Create and add UI components (e.g., canvas, buttons, etc.)

            frame.setVisible(true);
        });
    }
}
```

2. **State and Transition Representation**:

```java
class State {
    private String name;
    private boolean isStart;
    private boolean isAccepting;

    // Getters and setters
}

class Transition {
    private State sourceState;
    private State targetState;
    private String symbol;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

3. **Simulation**:

```java
public class AutomatonSimulator {
    public boolean simulateAutomaton(Automaton automaton, String input) {
        // Implement the simulation logic here
        return false; // Return true for acceptance, false for rejection
    }
}
```

4. **Visualization**:

   - For visualization, you can use graphics libraries like Java2D to draw states and transitions on the canvas.

5. **File I/O**:

   - Use Java's File I/O classes (e.g., `FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`, `ObjectInputStream`, `ObjectOutputStream`) to save and load automaton configurations.

This outline and code snippets provide a starting point for your Automata Simulator project. 
As you progress, you'll need to build out the features, handle complexities, and ensure a user-friendly interface. 
Additionally, you may want to explore libraries like JUNG or JGraphX to assist with graph visualization, especially if your project becomes more intricate.
