**Research Objectives:**

1. **New Automata Models in Python**: Develop Python libraries to create and manipulate new automata models, such as quantum automata or probabilistic automata, and explore their computational power.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Utilize automata and formal language theory to enhance NLP applications, including tokenization, parsing, and sentiment analysis, with Python-based implementations.

3. **Automata-Based Compilers**: Design and implement a compiler using automata theory concepts, providing a real-world application of automata in software development.

4. **Automata Visualization Tools**: Create Python-based tools for visualizing automata and grammars, aiding in both education and research.

5. **Quantum Automata Simulation**: Develop Python scripts for simulating quantum automata, demonstrating their capabilities in quantum computing and cryptography.

6. **Complexity Analysis with Python**: Use Python to analyze the time and space complexity of automata algorithms, contributing to complexity theory.

**Methodology:**

- Develop Python libraries and modules for creating and manipulating automata, grammars, and languages.

- Implement automata-based solutions in Python for practical applications, such as NLP, compilers, and formal verification.
