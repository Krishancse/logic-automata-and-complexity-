Research Project Title: "Automata Theory in Natural Language Processing and Text Compression"

**Project Overview:**
Automata theory, a branch of theoretical computer science, has significant applications in natural language processing (NLP) and text compression. This research project aims to explore and apply automata theory to NLP tasks, develop finite-state transducers for morphological analysis of languages, and investigate automata-based methods for text compression. These three aspects of automata theory will contribute to more efficient and effective language processing and data compression techniques.

**Research Objectives:**

1. **Automata in NLP:**
   - Investigate the application of finite automata and regular languages in natural language processing tasks such as text parsing, tokenization, and sentiment analysis.
   - Develop algorithms and models that leverage automata theory to improve the efficiency and accuracy of NLP tasks.

2. **Finite-State Transducers for Morphological Analysis:**
   - Design and implement finite-state transducers (FSTs) for morphological analysis of languages. FSTs are valuable tools for stemming and lemmatization.
   - Explore techniques to optimize FSTs for specific languages and linguistic features.

3. **Automata-Based Text Compression:**
   - Research and develop text compression methods based on automata theory, particularly finite automata and Huffman coding.
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of automata-based compression methods in terms of compression ratio and decompression speed.

**Methodology:**

1. **Automata in NLP:**
   - Review existing literature on the application of automata theory in NLP.
   - Develop algorithms and models that utilize finite automata for tasks like tokenization and regular expression matching.
   - Evaluate the performance of automata-based NLP solutions on benchmark datasets.

2. **Finite-State Transducers for Morphological Analysis:**
   - Study the theory and construction of finite-state transducers.
   - Implement FSTs for morphological analysis in selected languages.

3. **Automata-Based Text Compression:**
   - Investigate the principles of finite automata and Huffman coding for text compression.
   - Develop a text compression algorithm that combines these principles.
   - Evaluate the compression efficiency and decompression speed of the proposed method using standard text corpora.

**Expected Outcomes:**

1. Automata-based NLP models and algorithms that offer improved efficiency and accuracy in text processing tasks.
